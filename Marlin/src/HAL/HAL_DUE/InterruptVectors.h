/**
 * InterruptVectors_Due.h
 *
 * This module relocates the Interrupt vector table to SRAM, allowing new
 * interrupt handlers to be added at runtime. This is required because the
 * Arduino runtime steals interrupt handlers that Marlin MUST use to support
 * extended functionality such as USB hosts and USB devices (MSD, MTP) and
 * custom serial port handlers. Rather than modifying and/or recompiling the
 * Arduino runtime, We just want to run as much as possible on Stock Arduino.
