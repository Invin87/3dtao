 * Low level pin manipulation routines - used by all the drivers.

 * These are based on the LPC1768 pinMode, digitalRead & digitalWrite routines.
 *
 * Couldn't just call exact copies because the overhead killed the LCD update speed
 * With an intermediate level the softspi was running in the 10-20kHz range which
 * resulted in using about about 25% of the CPU's time.
